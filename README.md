## 🧠 Overview

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** in the telecom industry using machine learning models. Churn prediction allows telecom companies to proactively retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

The project compares several models, applies hyperparameter tuning, addresses class imbalance, and selects the best-performing one based on F1-score and ROC AUC.

## 🗂️ Dataset

- 📌 Source: [WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palashfendarkar/wa-fnusec-telcocustomerchurn)  
- 💡 7,000+ customer records with features such as:
    - Demographics (e.g., gender, senior citizen)
    - Services used (e.g., internet service, phone service)
    - Account information (e.g., tenure, payment method)
    - Target: `Churn` (Yes/No)

# ⚙️ Project Workflow

An all-in-one machine learning pipeline for **customer churn prediction**.  
Easily configurable and designed for **single-line execution**, with options for:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Imbalanced data handling (SMOTE)  
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV)  
- Model training with cross-validation  
- Model comparison (Accuracy, Recall, AUC)  
- Voting Classifier for ensemble performance  
- Feature importance visualization  

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Plug-and-play**: run with just a CSV file path.  
- **Configurable**: choose whether to use feature engineering, SMOTE, and which models to train.  
- **Comprehensive EDA**: churn distributions, categorical breakdowns, correlation heatmaps.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: automatic search for optimal model parameters.  
- **Multiple Models** out of the box:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Machine
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Naive Bayes
  - XGBoost *(optional, if installed)*  
- **Automatic Model Selection**: highlights the best-performing model.  
- **Voting Classifier**: combines models for better performance.  
- **Visual Results**: comparison plots and confusion matrices.
